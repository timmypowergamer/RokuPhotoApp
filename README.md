# RokuPhotoApp
Flickr group photo pool viewer for Roku

Comes configured with 5 pre-set groups of cute animals to browse through, and the option to enter any flickr group id.

To compile this, you must first add your Flickr API key to the config_template.json and then save it as "config.json".
You can configure the groups that come included from there as well.
